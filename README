A simple pad controller on Arduino Nano with MCP23017 for butons input (easier than a matrix)
Schematics for electronic is on the repo

the pad contains 16 "pad buttons" sending notes on/of from 60 to 82(on 2 pages)

under the pad are 4 "function buttons" :
the left is the "page change" buttons , switching between the 2 pages
the 3 other buttons are "controll change" buttons (CC20,21,22)
  sending control change with value of 127 OR 0
  
  
This pad was created for control the amazing seq24 on linux.
It works with TTYmidi (Linux) plugged in jack over a2jmidid

I'll write a "protocol" page to explain how it works... but it's sooooo easy


for the 4x4 pad , nano reads the MCP GPIOAB sending a uint16_t word
access to "buton position" is done by masking => less memory used (and less work for arduino)
